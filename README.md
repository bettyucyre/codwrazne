# How to Get Unbanned on CoD Warzone (2025 Guide) 🚀

Getting banned from CoD Warzone can feel like being kicked out of the coolest party in town — especially if you’re convinced it was a mix-up. Don’t sweat it! This quick and friendly guide will show you how to figure out why you got banned, what to do next, and how to appeal for a second chance at the battlegrounds.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did you get banned right after making a fresh account, or does your ban follow you across multiple profiles? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! In simple terms, CoD Warzone has flagged your PC’s hardware, making it tricky to slide back into matches even with new accounts.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

- Cheating, hacking, or using third-party cheat tools  
- Being toxic, griefing, or harassing other players  
- Account sharing or suspicious login activity  

**Pro Tip:** Always skim the Activision Terms of Service before firing off an appeal.
